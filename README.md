# R Projects
Assorted Projects in R


##Getting Started
###First, install...
  Git Bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  R: https://www.r-project.org/
  R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/
###Second, ....
  Create GitHub account: https://github.com/
  Create new repository in GitHub
###In Git Bash
  ```
  mkdir ~/R
  ```
The above command creates a directory on your PC called R.
```
  cd ~/R
```
The above command moves your working directory to the newly created R directory

```
git init
```
The above command initializes an empty git repository in your new C:/users/username/r/.git/ repo.
After I initialized I created (manually) a new file in the R folder called nmrcsurvey, and added R Code.


```
git remote add origin https://github.com/sammcq/R.git
```
```
  git add .
  ```
  ```
  git commit -m "created first merge file"
```
```
git push -u origin master
```
Need to understand what previous command did. 
#Basic Git Bash Commands
